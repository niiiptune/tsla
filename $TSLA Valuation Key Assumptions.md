1. No FSD licensing profit. This is unlikely but it would take time for other manufacturers to adapt FSD into their cars.
2. No FSD in China (and anywhere else except US). FSD is already "approved" in China, but I assume the profit margin would be low. Few Chinese would pay US $20 for this service no matter how good it is. 
3. Robotaxi is North America only (in 2025-26 only available in CA+TX). EU simply refuse to approve it, which is likely.
4. Regulatory credit sales gradually reduce from 2B/yr to zero (worst case).
5. Energy business line remains 50% growth rate and 30% profit margin.
6. Tesla car sales remains 500k/yr in US. Highly unlikely if 25-30k model is released, but as of now it's not the top priority of the team.
7. Inflation is not considered. I expected real annual inflation to be at least 3% over the next decade.
8. Once unsupervised FSD is approved, Tesla only have an execution problem for the next decade, which is what Elon & team are good at. 
9. New products such as Optimus robots are not in scope for this analysis.
